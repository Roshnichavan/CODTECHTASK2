Project Overview
Objective:
To create a Python program that allows users (students or teachers) to input, calculate, and analyze student grades. The calculator will handle grade input, compute averages, and provide insights such as highest and lowest grades.

Features:
Grade Input:

Allow users to input grades for multiple students.
Option to input grades for different subjects or exams.
Grade Calculations:

Calculate average grades for each student.
Determine the highest and lowest grades for each subject or exam.
Optionally, compute weighted averages if different assessments have different importance.
Data Storage:

Store grades in a data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries or a Pandas DataFrame).
Option to save data to and load data from a file (e.g., CSV).
Reporting:

Display individual student grades and overall performance.
Generate summary reports or statistics.
User Interface:

Command-line interface (CLI) for simplicity.
Optionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or PyQt.
Components:
